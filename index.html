            Rules
        </p>
        <p>This is a BJJ version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
            To begin, you will play a game of RPSLS to determine who makes the first move, you or the computer.
            The winner then makes a move and you play again. If you start first, you keep making advancing moves until
            you lose a game of RSPLS. Once you lose, the computer then can advance and keeps advancing until they lose.
